## Uses of Tezos

Tezos \(the tez\) is a currency first, a smart contract platform second. Tezos is smart money, redefining what it means to hold and exchange value in a digitally connected world. A self-upgradable blockchain with a proven track record, Tezos seamlessly adopts tomorrow's innovations without network disruptions today. 

Tezos is also built to incentivize developers, any developer can submit a protocol upgrade with an invoice attached and the community of Bakers \(validators\) will be able to vote on the protocol upgrade with its formal built-in governance mechanism.

**Use Cases**

Public blockchains derive their value from network effects and comprise of more than just an underlying technology or base layer. There’s a vast interplay between the underlying technology and its corresponding structure that can best be viewed as “digital nations”. In the same way a nation today is structured with a governing body, fiscal policy, social hierarchy - these items also are present within blockchain networks such as Tezos. 

For a smart contract platform facilitating formally-verified and security thereof to the highest degree of smart contracts, platforms such as Tezos offer a wide range of applications.
